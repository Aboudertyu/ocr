## Kingdom Statistics

Command line tools to help collect player statistics from [Rise of Kingdoms](https://rok.lilithgames.com/en). By analyzing screenshots we can extract various data points such as governor power, deaths, kills and more. This can help with various kingdom statistics or fairly distributing [KvK](https://rok.guide/the-lost-kingdom-kvk/) rewards.
