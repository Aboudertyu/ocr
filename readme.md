## Kingdom Statistics

Command line tools to help collect player statistics from [Rise of Kingdoms](https://rok.lilithgames.com/en). By analyzing screenshots we can extract various data points such as governor power, deaths, kills and more. This can help with various kingdom statistics or fairly distributing [KvK](https://rok.guide/the-lost-kingdom-kvk/) rewards.

## Features

- Character recognition by [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
- Fast hash based image comparison
- Automated pick of best-match template (based on first image in media directory)

## Future Plans

- Docker image with all the dependencies (Tesseract libs, and language data files)
- Easy to use WebUI. Just open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/), upload files, and get results directly in your browser (with a simple `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 $IMAGE`) 
- Ability to use multiple templates in single run
- Discord BOT mode. (Process each image sent to a specific discord channel)
- Automate screnshot collection using ADB & Memu/LDPLay/real android device

## Limitations

- English language is preferred as coordinate information lines up most accurately with English.
- No way to merge user information from different screens.
- Best template is detected automatically, but same template is used for all files in media directory.
- Requires properly defined template

## Getting started

git clone https://github.com/xor22h/rok-monster-ocr-golang
